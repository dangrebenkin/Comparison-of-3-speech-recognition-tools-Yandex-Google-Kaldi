There is a work comparison of Kaldi(kaldi-ru 0.6), Yandex Speech Kit and Google Speech API, I used a validation subset of open_stt (https://github.com/snakers4/open_stt/) - Russian speech dataset. During the recognition I noticed that Google and Yandex tools wrote some numbers as numbers, not as the words (like "1" instead of "один"), so I fixed it.

Finally, Yandex had the best values, especially it was good at recognition of short files; Kaldi spend the most amount of time to recognize 28111 files - it was about 12 hours. But I think Kaldi is still good to use because you can tune it whatever you want in comparison with Google and Yandex tools, which servers are far from you.
